= Cordapp Template =

This template contains the build system and an example application required to get started with [Corda](http://todo.todo).

== Prerequisites ==

You will need to have [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) 
installed and available on your path.

== Getting Started ==

First clone this repository and the Corda repository locally. Then open a terminal window in the Corda directory and run:
 
Unix: 

     ./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
     
Windows:

     gradle.bat publishToMavenLocal
     
This will publish a copy of Corda to your local Maven repository for your Cordapp to use. Next open a terminal window
in your Cordapp directory (this one) and run:

Unix:

     ./gradlew deployNodes
     
Windows:

     gradlew.bat deployNodes
     
This command will create several nodes in `build/nodes` that you can now run with:

Unix:

     cd build/nodes
     ./runnodes

Windows:

Windows users currently have to manually enter each directory in `build/nodes` and run `java -jar corda.jar` in each.
This will be updated soon.

This will now have nodes running on your machine running this Cordapp. You can now begin developing your Cordapp.
