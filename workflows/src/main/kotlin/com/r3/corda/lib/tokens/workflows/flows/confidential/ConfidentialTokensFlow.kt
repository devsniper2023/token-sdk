/**
 * This flow extracts the holders from a list of tokens to be issued on ledger, then requests only the well known
 * holders to generate a new key pair for holding the new asset. The new key pair effectively anonymises them. The
 * newly generated public keys replace the old, well known, keys. The flow doesn't request new keys for
 * [AnonymousParty]s.
 *
 * This is an in-line flow and use of it should be paired with [ConfidentialTokensFlowHandler].
 *
 * Note that this flow should only be called if you are dealing with [Party]s as individual nodes, i.e. not accounts.
 * When issuing tokens to accounts, the public keys + tokens need to be generated up-front as passed into the
 * [IssueTokensFlow].
 *
 * @property tokens a list of [AbstractToken]s.
 * @property sessions a list of participants' sessions which may contain sessions for observers.
